# clpsych24-task
This repo contains the work of the UniBuc
Archaeology team for CLPsychâ€™s 2024 Shared
Task, which involved finding evidence within
the text supporting the assigned suicide risk
level. Two types of evidence were required:
highlights (extracting relevant spans within the
text) and summaries (aggregating evidence into
a synthesis). Our work focuses on evaluating
Large Language Models (LLM) as opposed
to an alternative method that is much more
memory and resource efficient. The first ap-
proach employs a good old-fashioned machine
learning (GOML) pipeline consisting of a tf-idf
vectorizer with a logistic regression classifier,
whose representative features are used to ex-
tract relevant highlights. The second, more
resource intensive, uses an LLM for generat-
ing the summaries and is guided by chain-of-
thought to provide sequences of text indicating
clinical markers.
